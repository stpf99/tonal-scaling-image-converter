Scaling conversion involves identifying the initial values of a given RGB color occurrence. When these values are decreasing or increasing toward extreme values, the generation of the scaled result takes these into account and incorporates a smooth tonal transition between them. This means that if the color initially appears stronger and then transitions to a weaker intensity (or vice versa, maintaining the same color but growing in intensity), this is also considered. During the regeneration process, the corresponding values are multiplied and filled with either a rising or falling tonal transition accordingly.
